 * Capability definitions for block_patchmanager.

 * These control who may place the block. They never control what it shows:
 * the content itself is gated on local/patchmanager:view at render time, so
 * adding the block can never reveal patch state to someone who could not
 * already read it on the Patch Manager page.
